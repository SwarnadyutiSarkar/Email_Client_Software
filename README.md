# Email_Client_Software
 In this extended example:

A receiveButton is added to the GUI, which, when clicked, calls the receiveEmails method to fetch emails from the inbox.
The receiveEmails method connects to an IMAP email server using the javax.mail library, fetches unread emails from the inbox, and displays the summaries of these emails in the inboxListView.
Please replace the placeholder values (youremail@example.com, yourpassword, imap.example.com) with your actual email address, password, and IMAP server details.

To run this code:

Create a new Java file named EmailClient.java.
Copy and paste the above code into EmailClient.java.
Replace the placeholder values with your actual email and server details.
Add the javax.mail and javafx libraries to your Java project's classpath.
Compile and run the EmailClient.java file in VSCode.
This example provides a basic email client functionality with sending and receiving emails. You can further extend this example to add more advanced features like handling attachments, managing folders, etc.
Replace SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, IMAP_HOST, IMAP_PORT, EMAIL, and PASSWORD with your email provider's SMTP and IMAP settings.

The sendEmail() method takes a recipient email address, subject, and body as arguments and sends an email using the SMTP server.

The getInbox() method connects to the IMAP server and retrieves the list of emails in the inbox as EmailMessage objects.

The EmailMessage class is a simple container for the email's sender, subject, and body.

Note that this is a basic example and doesn't include error handling or user interface. You may want to add additional functionality such as filtering the inbox by date or sender, or providing a user interface for composing and sending emails.

You can also divide this code into multiple files for better organization and modularity. For example, you can move the EmailMessage class to its own file and the EmailClient class to its own file. You can also add a MailServer class to encapsulate the SMTP and IMAP settings for each email provider
